## Technical Commentary
<details>
<ul>
    <li>
        First time using React Native. With limited screen area, UI design and prioritising utility is almost compulsory.

    <li>
        Installed Axios. Everytime I have to integrate third party API that I have no control of, I need to dig into the API documentation. But I am used to it after learning many languages and frameworks on my own.
